### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a data scientist at UK Power Networks, working on forecasting, power systems modelling and other data-driven projects to support the energy transition. 

My PhD at UCL focused on reinforcement learning for the unit commitment problem; you can find the environment I designed to simulate this problem in [`rl4uc`](https://github.com/pwdemars/rl4uc), and the methods I used to solve it in [`ts4uc`](https://github.com/pwdemars/ts4uc). 

More recently, I've been working on indoor temperature prediction for residential buildings and optimisation of heating (public repo coming soon!)

Another project I'm proud of is my work on the Western Power Distribution data science competition, forecasting demand and solar PV to optimise a grid-scale battery. This project has its own [website](https://ayrtonb.github.io/WPD-DS-Challenge/). 

Feel free to get in touch with questions or opportunities to collaborate. ðŸŒ±
