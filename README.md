### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a lecturer at UCL in Energy and Data, where I research applications of machine learning to problems in energy systems. My PhD focused on reinforcement learning for the unit commitment problem; you can find the environment I designed to simulate this problem in [`rl4uc`](https://github.com/pwdemars/rl4uc), and the methods I used to solve this problem in [`ts4uc`](https://github.com/pwdemars/ts4uc). 

More recently, I've been working on indoor temperature prediction for residential buildings and optimisation of heating (public repo coming soon!)

Another project I'm proud of is my work on the Western Power Distribution data science competition, forecasting demand and solar PV to optimise a grid-scale battery. This project has its own [website](https://ayrtonb.github.io/WPD-DS-Challenge/).
